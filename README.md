Data Model and Forecasting using ML/AI
The hourly energy consumption data from the US eastern states consit from 2008-2022.
Forecasting is a technique that uses historical data as inputs to make informed estimates that are predictive in determining the direction of future trends.
Businesses utilize forecasting to determine how to allocate their budgets or plan for anticipated expenses for an upcoming period of time. This is typically based on the projected demand for the goods and services offered.

1. Qualitative Techniques
Qualitative forecasting models are useful in developing forecasts with a limited scope. These models are highly reliant on expert opinions and are most beneficial in the short term.

2. Time Series Analysis
A time series analysis looks at historical data and how various variables have interacted with one another in the past. These statistical relationships are then extrapolated into the future to generate forecasts along with confidence intervals to understand the likelihood of the actual outcomes falling within that scope. As with all forecasting methods, success is not guaranteed.

3. Econometric Inference
Another quantitative approach is to look at cross-sectional data to identify links among variablesâ€”although identifying causation is tricky and can often be spurious. This is known as econometric analysis, which often employs regression models. Techniques such as the use of instrumental variables, if available, can help one make stronger causal claims.
